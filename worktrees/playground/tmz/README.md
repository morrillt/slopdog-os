# freellmfunny

A standalone Next.js application designed to evaluate and compare multiple free LLM models available via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/). 

## Genesis

This project was built as part of a test comparing various open-source models against **Gemini 3 Flash (flash3)** to "one-shot" create this entire application.

The design was guided by a dual-format PRD approach—a neat style inspired by **BMAD**:
- [**MD Version (Human Readable)**](./plans/LLM_Evaluator_PRD.md): Created for personal review and readability.
- [**XML Version (AI Optimized)**](./plans/LLM_Evaluator_PRD.xml): Structured specifically for the AI to ingest and execute against.

## Features

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Select up to 5 free models and prompt them simultaneously.
- **Real-time Streaming**: View parallel streaming responses from all active models.
- **Performance Profiling**: Automatic tracking of Tokens Per Second (TPS), Total Duration, and response size.
- **Catppuccin Theme**: Beautiful UI based on the Catppuccin Mocha palette.
- **Persistence**: All settings and conversations are persisted to local flat files.
- **Quick Filters**: Easily filter models by provider (Qwen, Google, NVIDIA, DeepSeek, etc.).
- **Smart Data Policy Detection**: Clear guidance on enabling OpenRouter's free model training policies.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ (App Router)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Theming**: Catppuccin
- **API**: OpenRouter Chat Completions
